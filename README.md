### Considerations
* I'm not a ruby programmer... yet.
* I've researched a lot of ruby syntax and documentation on the internet. It wouldn't be possible for me to complete this challenge in offline mode.
* The class status_printer counts and prints each type of cell at moment. It's another way to show the table state. As it was one of the last things I made, I tried to use some advanced methods I'm used to in Javascript like groupBy and reduce.
* There are tests that validates the solution.
* You can play the game with the ```bin/minesweeper_game.rb``` file to check the solution.
* I had fun with the challenge. Thank you.
